# Free Code Camp's 2016 New Coder Survey

Free Code Camp announced on [March 29th,
2016](https://twitter.com/FreeCodeCamp/status/714930182721679360) that we'd like  to better understand new coders using a survey. This idea stemmed from [Stack Overflow's own developer survey for 2016](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016).

Free Code Camp's survey development was lead by [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia) and [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek). More on why we made this survey can be found on our Medium article, ["How we crafted a survey for thousands of people who are learning to code"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-just-launched-the-biggest-ever-survey-of-people-learning-to-code-cac81dadf1ea#.8g9ts8gm5).

## About the Data

The survey results are located in the [`data/`](data/) directory and is split up into two files:

- [2016 New Coders Survey-report first section of survey.csv](data/2016 New Coders Survey-report first section of survey.csv)
- [2016 New Coders Survey second section of survey.csv](data/2016 Survey of New Coders second section of survey.csv)
